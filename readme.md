# Indb.js - A wrapper over the messy IndexedDB event handlers

Hi. This JavaScript class allows you to work with IndexedDB in the browser. You no longer need to manually handle `onsuccess`, `onerror`, `oncomplete`, and so on. This code takes care of everything.

Your only task is to write requests and enjoy the results.

To understand how it works, please check the documentation. Everything is clearly described there, complete with examples and theory.

Finally, I’ll just say that this tool has helped me in several projects, and I’m glad I wrote it.
